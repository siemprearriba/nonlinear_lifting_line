# Aircraft Wing Design with Nonlinear Lifting Line

In this routine, aircraft wing parameters including taper ratio, aspect ratio, wing incidence, and geometric twist are designed using nonlinear lifting line theory. Airfoil data is integrated into the application of lifting line theory. This tool results in fairly good results for a conceptual design of an aircraft.

This tool can be used to achieve the desired elliptical lift distribution with desired design lift coefficient which minimizes the induced drag (i.e. drag due to lift).
